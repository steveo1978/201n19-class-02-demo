  <p>Welcome, hi, hello. Glad you could make it to the craziest place on earth. My mind is often filled with monkeys,juggling,riding unicycles, but today, no. Today you're in for a treat, because instead of juggling monkey's, you get to learn just what makes me tic....Well sort of. Well let's get into it !</p>


  <article> You already know my name is Steven, but you can call me <i>SteveO.</i>  I was born in 1978 in Oklahoma City,Oklahoma. I moved to eastern Washington when I was 7 or 6 I don't really remember my age then. where I had lived on top of a mountain, 50 or so  miles from the nearest town. I moved to Everett in 1986 then finally moved to Marysville in 1987. I graduated high school in 1997 where then I started college but after 6 months of straight work and school I got sick and had to drop out.<br />

  Once I felt better I immediately went to work where I had jobs such as a furniture delivery guy, a construction and industrial parts delivery guy, a shop boy and as a door-to-door vaccuum cleaner salesmen. I sold 12 vaccuums and never saw a penny, had to use my own car and gas to get to customers houses too. One day while out in the middle of knowhere in a run down trailer attempting to sell a 1500 vaccume to poor people my bestfriend called and told me that Waste Management had an opening for another garbage collector. So I quit on the spot, and no I didnt make a sale that day but I did however get a shiny new vaccume cleaner though !  ;) <br />


    A couple weeks later I was driving as a garbage man or  <i>Sanitary specialist</i>   as like to call it. Almost exactly at my 2 year mark of driving with Waste Management one day, while out on my route, my clipboard had slid over to the work side of the truck where I was standing. It locked my steeering wheel in place and before I could throw it outta the way it was too late, I was being pulled into the ditch on the side of the road and rolled the truck on it's side. It was not long after I was once again without a job, and needing to figure something out  <strong>QUICK</strong> ! After day 2 of me being unemployed it happened, Sept.11<sup>th</sup>2001

  A day im sure you remember well. I knew what it was that I needed to do, and That was join the military.<br />

    I went to the only open office which was the Navy and signed up. I didn't even tell my wife, I just did it. She mind you was <strong>PISSED</strong>, but she quickly got over it. While in the military I got to travel to 4 states and 15 different Countrys. In the service my job or rate, as it's called was an Aviation Ordnanceman or AO for short. As an AO I built bombs and missles that got loaded on to the FA-18 super hornet, and as a member of the weapons department I also stood all security gun watches and trained new sailors and old sailors how to shoot and helped with keeping their quals up to par. I was also a member of the fast attack small inflatable rib boat crew where I manned the m60 machine gun. I did see a lot of stuff and got to do a lot of different things while in the military, but that's another story, for another time. Once I was honorably discharged after 8 years of service to this fine, outstanding Country I moved back from sunny San Diego, back here to Washington state in Marysville.<br />

    Where I became an aircraft electrician and team lead at the Boeing Company where I worked at until 2018.<br />

    My goals are to finally find a career that I can retire at, and at the same time make some damn good money while I'm at it.
